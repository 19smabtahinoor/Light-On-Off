# Light-In-off
In this repository, I made a simple project by using HTML,CSS & Javascript.If you see the project,you can see the two button.These are:Turn on button and Turn off button.At the middle you can see a image of a light.




#How I make this?
First, I put Turn On button,a white light and a Turn Off button.Then I create a function in the Javascript file.After I using onclick method in the button.You can understand very clearly by downloading my codes.When a event occurs,I called the yellow light from the function.This is a very simple trick to make light on/off projects.
